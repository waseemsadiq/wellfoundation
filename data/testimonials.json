I was Particularly interested in their clean water projects and decided to contribute to one of them. I was given an accurate account of the works and provided photographs on completion. Me and my family were very impressed with the high standard of work and were kept informed of progress throughout. It is amazing that this charity and its team work thanklessly and selflessly all year around. I will always support them,  their work makes a great impact and every penny goes towards the cause. A supporter for life!",
