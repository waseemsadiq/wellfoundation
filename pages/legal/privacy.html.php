      <p class="mb-4">All requests to The Well Foundation start a session which stores the IP address in the session data and creates a session cookie in the user's browser. The IP address is used as a security measure to help protect against potential session hijacking attacks and this information is deleted once the session has expired and its data purged. The session cookie's name is based on a randomly generated hash and therefore does not have a constant identifier. The session cookie is destroyed once the session has expired or the user has exited their browser.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">The Well Foundation's logging system records the IP address of the visitor which led to a message being written to its log files. These log files are used to record various activity on The Well Foundation, including information related to core updates, invalid login attempts, unhandled errors, and development information such as the use of deprecated APIs.</p>
      <p>The Well Foundation supports a "Remember Me" feature, this creates a cookie on the user's client if a "Remember Me" checkbox is selected when logging into the website. This cookie can be used to automatically log users into the website when they visit and are not already logged in.</p>
